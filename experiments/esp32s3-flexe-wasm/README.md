# flexe WebAssembly feasibility probe

This is throwaway experiment code. It answers one question: can the pinned
flexe interpreter execute real Xtensa instructions after being compiled to
WebAssembly with the toolchain already used by Puck?

The answer is yes. At flexe commit
`34ea9eb6eef921b59a55e6a435c7fc55c5727835`, the interpreter and memory
implementation compile with Zig 0.16.0 as `wasm32-freestanding` after applying
a small hosted-C compatibility patch. A six-byte fixture executes `movi a3,
40` and `addi a3, a3, 2`. Native, WASI, and freestanding builds all return 42
from architectural register `a3`. The freestanding module is loaded by Puck's
real `src/wasm.ts` `instantiate()` function in the executable test.

This does not demonstrate ESP32-S3 support, LX7 or PIE instructions, a browser
page, timing, caches, dual-core scheduling, or an ESP-IDF boot. It proves that
flexe's direct interpreter can cross Puck's current WebAssembly loader boundary
without expanding WASI-lite.

## Run it

Requirements: Bun, Git, and Zig. The first command needs network access.

```text
bun run experiments/esp32s3-flexe-wasm/fetch.ts
bun run experiments/esp32s3-flexe-wasm/test.ts
bun run experiments/esp32s3-flexe-wasm/isa-inventory.ts
```

`FLEXE_SOURCE` can point at an existing clean checkout. It must be at the exact
commit and every file in the dependency closure must match its recorded SHA-256.
`ZIG_EXE` can select another Zig executable. Generated binaries live in ignored
`dist/` and include the upstream MIT license.

The ISA inventory additionally needs Espressif's
`xtensa-esp32s3-elf-objdump` and the two named TinyDraw ELFs below. Override
their paths with `ESP32S3_OBJDUMP`, `TINYDRAW_ESP32S3_ELF`, and
`TINYDRAW_ESP32S3_FIXTURE_ELF`. The generated JSON stays in ignored `dist/`.

## ESP32-S3 ISA gap inventory

`isa-inventory.ts` validates the ELF format, Xtensa architecture, ESP32-S3
IRAM, flash, and DRAM address ranges, and the architecture-specific objdump
name before disassembling anything. Missing files, a generic or wrong-target
objdump, and non-ESP32-S3 ELFs are rejected. The report records every
objdump encoding and mnemonic pair, counts it, and compares its normalized
mnemonic to the exact pinned flexe decoder source. Special-register forms such
as `rsr.ccount` normalize to flexe's generic `rsr` decoder entry.

The current input is
`out/build/esp32-panel-probe/tinydraw_esp32.elf`, 5,567,916 bytes, SHA-256
`87d6a00ffdf18c9bcb7dd3742658b5a1786212f939f5cbafe1b82562a350f70f`.
The tool is GNU objdump 2.45 from Espressif crosstool-NG
`esp-15.2.0_20251204`, SHA-256
`90a91caa519b895bd457f4eb7c5fd6b14a9c64c0c7d946e78e7f332ea57d7466`.
The flexe decoder is `src/xtensa_disasm.c` at the pinned commit, SHA-256
`68f98a684b964dd36d778f755441242496f624f0ffbc68c789c7c25e2862f3d0`.

That ELF yields 64,262 objdump rows and 343 raw mnemonics. The pinned flexe
decoder surface has 319 normalized mnemonics. It covers 63,193 rows and 296
raw mnemonics; 1,069 rows and 47 raw mnemonics are gaps. The 47 gaps are 41
`ee.*` PIE mnemonics covering 349 rows, 689 undecodable `.byte` rows, plus
`ld.qr` (8), `lsip` (6), `s32nb` (1), `ssip` (8), and `st.qr` (8).

These are static surface counts. `objdump -d` linearly interprets executable
sections, including unreachable padding and literal pools, so the row ratio is
not execution coverage. The JSON retains first addresses, symbols, exact
encodings, and counts so each gap can be separated from false static decodes.
`esp32s3-isa-baseline.json` tracks every unsupported mnemonic and row count;
the integration test rejects any unreviewed ELF, toolchain, decoder, coverage,
gap, or first-fixture-instruction change.
Only factual disassembly rows and hashes are retained. No GNU or Espressif
source or binary is copied into the experiment.

The executable fixture is
`out/build/esp32-vector-v2-simd-probe/tinydraw_esp32.elf`, SHA-256
`2293fb3d35ba2f785e4dce5dfb35d2f33e452150167dc8d24f0e091cfa3e6d53`.
With `a4` nonzero, `tinydraw_stage_pixels_swapped_pie` executes flexe-supported
`entry`, `nop.n`, and `loopnez`, then reaches the first decoder gap at
`0x40377a54`: objdump encoding `830124`, `ee.vld.128.ip q0, a2, 16`. This is a
real named TinyDraw PIE kernel, not a linear decode from a literal pool.

## Minimal interpreter dependency closure

The successful build copies six upstream implementation files and headers:

- `src/xtensa.c`
- `src/xtensa.h`
- `src/memory.c`
- `src/memory.h`
- `src/rom_stubs.h`
- `src/elf_symbols.h`

`rom_stubs.h` is needed only for its inline hook-bitmap test, and it pulls in
the forward declarations from `elf_symbols.h`. No JIT, JIT stub, loader,
peripheral model, ROM stub implementation, session layer, flexe OpenSSL,
pthread, socket, VFS, or file loader implementation is linked.
`PREDECODE_FLASH_MB=0` removes the optional large predecode allocation. The
patches add the probe entry point and compatibility boundary to a temporary
copy. No upstream source is vendored here.

The ISA inventory reads and hashes upstream `src/xtensa_disasm.c` as an
analysis input. It is not copied into the build closure or linked into either
probe.

## Loader result and remaining blockers

The stripped freestanding module is 37,946 bytes with Zig 0.16.0. It imports
only `env.js_log` and exports only `memory` and `flexe_wasm_probe`. Those names
are audited before `puck-loader-test.ts` passes the bytes to Puck's real loader
and asserts architectural result 42. It has no WASI imports.

The WASI build remains as a comparison. Zig's WASI libc introduces six imports.
Puck supports `fd_write` and `proc_exit`, but correctly rejects `environ_get`,
`environ_sizes_get`, `fd_close`, and `fd_seek`. `test.ts` asserts that exact
boundary without weakening the loader.

The unmodified source does not compile for `wasm32-freestanding` because
`src/memory.h` includes `string.h`, which the freestanding target does not
provide. `freestanding-blocker.ts` executes the raw upstream compile and
asserts the exact diagnostic. `0002-add-freestanding-shim.patch` supplies:

- local `memcpy` and `memset` loops;
- a fixed 20 MiB bump allocator for `calloc`, with `free` as a no-op;
- an empty environment that disables flexe's debug constructor settings;
- raw format-string logging through Puck's existing `env.js_log` import;
- WebAssembly-backed floating-point helpers for the LX6 FPU instructions;
- a trapping `abort` implementation.

The fixed heap makes the module's minimum memory 337 WebAssembly pages, about
21.06 MiB. It is enough for this pinned `mem_create()` layout and is not a
production ownership model. A real backend should let the host size and own
the regions, replace no-op `free`, and give diagnostic logging structured
arguments.

That is a bounded portability patch around the core. The bigger project risk
remains architectural: this commit models ESP32 LX6 addresses and instructions,
not the ESP32-S3 LX7, PIE extension, memory map, caches, or timing.
